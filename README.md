# Reloader Tracker

Reloader tracker is a REST based backend for managing reloading data and logs. 

There is currently no front end for this, and is very much in an alpha status.

User management is non existant and can only be done through the database.

My goal is to have a mostly functional system by the release of 2.0.

## Features

* Track components, prices and quantities
* Store recipes for specific rounds
* Recipe logs for recording shooting data, chronographs
* Record each batch and allow for variations on each batch
* Cost calculations for per round and batch
