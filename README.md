* ~~Load notes and shooting notes~~
* Ability to upload targets to a specific recipe
* Chronograph data (FPS)
	* Allow recording multiple entires into a recipe to report standard deviation, average fps, ect

* Group size
* ~~Recipe cartridge type (For sorting)~~
* Remove the "Current Amount/Count" for batches, really not useful
* Specific component data:
	* Bullet diameter/type
	* Bullet weight
	* Case length

* Compressed load flag
* Easy way for dealing with a pool of once fired brass
* Distance from lands
* Fix the fields that should be integers that are showing up as double/float (like count)
